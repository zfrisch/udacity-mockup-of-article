You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

1. I've learned to use the strong and em tags. I've also learned that strike is apparently out of use(haha, whoops!)
2. I've been programming in HTML for users so it's been easy to add new tags to my repertoire. 
3. It's difficult, I think, for anyone to become rigid when it comes to organizing code. I typically just throw it into dirtymarkup.com, but for Udacity I'm making an effort to do it manually! :)
4. Really when it comes down to it, the basic problem solving strategy is just to persevere. For instance, I messed up by not reading all the instructions(and I'll probably do that again by mistake haha. It's 12am and I've been working all day so my brain's a little fried :) ), but I resolve to finish this nanodegree asap, and I strive to fix any mistakes as quickly as possible. So far Udacity's been wonderful. I can't believe someone's reviewing my work 20 minutes after completion. I find that to be quite excellent.
